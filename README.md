Hi Reader,

This is my project where I used a basic neural network to catogorize different types of Iris using 4 parameters: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The flower type can be either of the following: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, or Iris Virginica. 
If you would like to insert measurements from your own flower to check what it is, please download the file and change the parameters here.
